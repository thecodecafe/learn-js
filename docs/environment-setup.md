## Introduction
So to start of we'll quickly setup our environment so we can test Javascripts console output. Although if you already have a place you can access the javascript console output from, then you can skip this step, but if you don't already have one just use any of the remommended options below, they are arrange from most to least recommended, but they are all great and okay for this.

## Google Chrome
To use the Google Chrome Developer Tool you will need to have a version of the Chrome Browser set up, so if you don't have the browser installed simply go [here](https://chrome.google.com) to download and install it, once you're done installing it, simply launch the browser and follow the steps below.

## Repl
Repl is an online text editor for writting code, so in this step you're not required to have any specific browser, you will only need to be online in order to write and test your code.
Sto start using Repl, you will need to have an account and be logged in on Repl so head over to [repl](https://repl.it) and sign up or log into your account. Once you've logged in simply follow the steps below to start writing and testing Javascript code.

### Step 1
Click on the **new repl +** button at the top of the page, this should display a modal.
<div class="fig-sm">

### Step 4
Once opened you should be able to execute Javascript code from here. The two places you should be concerned with right now are, the code playground(input) and the console(output), the code playground is where you will write your code, and the console is where you will see the result of your code.
<div class="fig-full">

![code playground and console](img/repl-env-step-4.png)
</div>

You can see we logged **Hello, world!** in the image above.

**NB:** You will need to click on the **Run** button at the top of the page to execute your code in the code playground.

## Finally
Alright so at this point we should have our environments ready, you can go ahead and familiarise yourself with any of the environments you chose out of the three.
